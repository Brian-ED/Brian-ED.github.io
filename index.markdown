### [Rayed-bqn](https://brian-ed.github.io/rayed-bqn-docs/) (game engine)
Working BQN library for making games.
I like to call rayed-bqn a game engine, since that's what I'm aiming for with the project. No idea what you need in a project to make it qualify as a game engine but i choose not to worry about it. It's fully functional, though breaking changes are pretty common.
